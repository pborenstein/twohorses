using a localhost

Testing a localhost requires you to have a server running on your machine. The most common way to do this is to install a web server such as Apache or Nginx. Once you have your web server installed, you can then use your browser to connect to the localhost address (usually 127.0.0.1). This will allow you to test any applications or websites you have running on your machine.
